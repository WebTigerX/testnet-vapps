# Proof Without Reveal ðŸŽ®

**Author:** WebTigerX

**Status:** Proposal (Testnet)  

---

## Summary
A zero-knowledge based proof system for gaming achievements.  
Players can prove they reached a level, unlocked an item, or completed a mission **without revealing the full game data**.  
This ensures privacy, reduces cheating, and still allows community recognition.

---

## Problem
- Gamers today must reveal screenshots or share raw account data to prove achievements.  
- This leads to **privacy leaks** and possible **fake proofs**.  
- Communities, guilds, and tournaments need a **trustless** way to verify milestones.

---

## Solution
- Use **ZK proofs** to confirm achievement conditions (e.g., "Level â‰¥ 20" or "Unlocked Sword of Truth").  
- No need to reveal player stats, only a proof that passes verification.  
- On-chain verification emits an event / badge.  
- Can integrate with **Discord bots** for auto-role assignment.

---

## Users
- Competitive gamers who want **verified ranks**.  
- Guilds / DAOs needing **trustless membership checks**.  
- Tournaments wanting **fair entry gating**.

---

## Architecture
1. **Client**: Game generates achievement data â†’ hashes/commitments.  
2. **ZK Circuit**: Proves condition (â‰¥ level, has item, etc.) without showing raw stats.  
3. **Verifier Contract** (on Soundness Layer): Checks proof + records attestation.  
4. **Discord Bot**: Links wallet and assigns achievement roles automatically.  

---

## Roadmap
- **Week 1**: Build circuits for "level threshold" + "item possession".  
- **Week 2**: Deploy verifier contract on Soundness Layer.  
- **Week 3**: Build demo UI + Discord integration.  
- **Stretch**: NFT badges / leaderboard system.

---

## Risks
- Proof generation speed (optimize for browser use).  
- Circuit complexity for multi-achievements.  
- Adoption from game devs (need SDKs).

---

## Success Criteria
- At least **2 working ZK achievement proofs** verified on Soundness Layer.  
- Discord role integration demo working in <2 minutes.  
- A public demo repo + docs.
